# E12a-Animation

This is an exercise completed for C220 Game Technology class at Indiana University which lets us first work with creating character rigs for animation in Blender. It also illustrates how to use character rigging to implement the animation in Godot. The rig in Blender is that of a human and controls movement at basic points. The animation in Godot goes from Idling to running within a game as controlled by keys.
